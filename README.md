###Design a database for:

###Jelly Beans
Storing jars of jellybeans. The database should have jars. Additionally, it should have jellybeans (each of which has a color) and a way to know what jar they are in.

###Trees
Managing the trees in my yard. I have a few different species of trees, and they all have their own leaves. I’ve noticed some of the leaves show signs of disease. Can you track that too?

###Blog
My blog website. It is a serious business blog, so we will have to add permissions such that each user can only change their posts and comments. I also want to be able to search for all posts and comments for a given user.

###Baseball
I want to keep track of teams, their players and their fans. While a player can only be on on one team, fans can like multiple teams. Pick a few attributes and their data types that might be important.

###University
I want to be able to search for a teacher’s classes, a student’s classes with their corresponding grades, and a class’s students. I also want to record pertinent information about these people and classes such as their names and contact details.

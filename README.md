##Goal
  * Practice designing relational database schemas for a variety of applications.

###Instructions
  * Tool: [SQL Designer](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/)
  * Use Rails/Active Record naming conventions
  * Label columns with ActiveRecord data types
    ie "name (string)"
  * You may save schemas in browser or as xml for future reference
  * Think about how it might look in rails, or try it out in AR playground?

###Design a database for:

###Jelly Beans
Storing jars of jellybeans. The database should have jars. Additionally, it should have jellybeans (each of which has a color) and a way to know what jar they are in.

###Trees
Managing the trees in my yard. I have a few different species of trees, and they all have their own leaves. I’ve noticed some of the leaves show signs of disease. Can you track that too?

###Blog
My blog website. It is a serious business blog, so we will have to add permissions such that each user can only change their posts and comments. I also want to be able to search for all posts and comments for a given user.

###University
Storing information about my university. I want to be able to search for a teacher’s classes, a student’s classes with their corresponding grades, and a class’s students. I also want to record pertinent information about these people and classes such as their names and contact details.
